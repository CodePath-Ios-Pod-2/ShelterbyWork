## Overview
### Description
Shows real estate available but narrowed down from company location radius. The goal is to be able to show comparisons of different housing metros and jobs available.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Business/Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:** Analyzes realestate available around company office locations
- **Market:** Users that are open to relocating for work and looking for best ROI for their career choice. This will streamline the process of looking for jobs and living in large metro areas.
- **Habit:** This app can be used when users are looking for a new job, new real estate to buy or rent or want to compare cost of living difference choices. This has an ability to thrive with the phenomenon of "Zillow Addiction" 
- **Scope:** First we would build a zillow type application but with searching company locations and looking at real estate within the radius of the chosen location. Could build future functionality focused torwards real estate or job postings.
